# Design of Compilers Project

This project implements a lexical and syntax analyzer for a programming language using Java Swing. It provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for users to input code, tokenize it, and perform syntax analysis to check its correctness.

## Features

- **Lexical Analysis**: Tokenizes input code, identifying keywords, identifiers, operators, delimiters, literals, and comments.
  
- **Syntax Analysis**: Checks the correctness of the code's structure according to predefined grammar rules. Detects syntax errors and provides appropriate error messages.



### Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK)
- IntelliJ IDEA or any other Java IDE

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in your preferred Java IDE.
3. Run the `Main.java` file to start the application.

## Usage

- Enter your code in the left text area.
- Click the "Tokenize this" button to perform lexical analysis and view the tokens in the right text area.
- Click the "Parse this" button to perform syntax analysis and view the parse tree.


## Built With

- Java - The main programming language used
- Java Swing - Used for creating the graphical user interface (GUI)
